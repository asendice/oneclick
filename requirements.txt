// One Click Onboarding //

##Overview of Business Problem
Company X is looking for a way to simplify the process by which new customers are onboarded.  
The current process requires multiple employees multiple hours across multiple days to collect, 
inspect and translate customer provided documents into a digestible format for software to make decisions and drive outputs.

##Product Solution
One click solution by which the customer can provide inputs and the software will enable the user to match criteria uploaded to requirements.

##Sample of Required Inputs
Apparel Example
SKU | Category | Size | Gender | Description | Materials | MSRP | Active_Date | Sunset_Date

For the purpose of this exercise assume that inputs are provided with a CSV upload.


Future State
Utilize inputs to predictive match (MSRP inside of uploaded data will propose a match to MSRP in required inputs)

#2) Analyze all CSV rows for missing data (ex: Customer uploads csv w/ SIZE missing from 20 rows - Identify those rows and present an error)
 
Analyze data for duplicated information (compare duplicated SKU and ask user to select source of truth)

Automated Data Feed with consideration for duplication/missing data as above 2 bullet points outline



CSV file will have headers -> Headers become draggable (as icons) to match to required inputs


Never got the vision for drag and drop,
well initially I  interpreted it as dragging to match
